#Script for automating data transformation from S&W Lab's GC
#Created by Keiran Cantilina
#Lasted edited by Keiran Cantilina on 8/24/2015 
 


#This script should magically take raw GC files and format them correctly for processing
#by Allison's Septic_R_code.R script, provided you fill out the batch description file correctly.

#It also spits out an error message if a given set from a given day and owner is incomplete (ie. you broke one/a few vials).
#If that happens, check the batch descriptions output file to see how far you got/where things got 
#stuck and replace the missing data with NAs or 0s.

#See example file to learn how to format description file correctly

#Chamber measurements will also be automatically moved to the correct directory if you have 
#them all stored in one folder (chdir).

#NOTE: DO NOT have an incomplete set as the last entry in the description file!!
#      The program can even work with out-of-order entries, as long as the last entry isn't a fragment.
